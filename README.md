# Blog
This was my first attempt at making my own blog system, with the design heavily inspired by dtelepathy to experiment with the use of subsection display and single-purpose home page designs.

The blog made use of a custom built javascript-powered WYSIWYG editor and uses PHP to store a page in an SQL database. The posts are account based.
